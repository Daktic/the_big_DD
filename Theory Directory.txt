Theories to test:

Fails To Deliver (FTD) are high for GME
    this may indicate naked short selling in the market.

There was not enough volume for Melvin and friends to close out of thier position
    see also OTC volume

the probability of a Intersteller yolo
    what are the risk factors?

I would like to compare Melvin Captials positions to GME and see if there is an inverse corelation in relative price, signaling melvin liqudating to stay afloat
